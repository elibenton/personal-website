  I have been sitting on this most recent post for the past week, unsure of how to discuss my experience at Kauwa Kunda. The community is largely comprised of people with leprosy who have been ostracized from their homes. They were kind, patient, and open with me—and all I can feel is shame.

## Lakshmi Bai

Lakshmi Bai estimated she was over 80. She did not have leprosy, but had been cast out by her two sons and four daughters all the same. Her husband had been a _Patwari,_ a government accountant with the Revenue Department where they lived. As such, she should have been entitled to a "government family" pension when he died—which is far greater the standard retirement pension, itself only 5 USD a month. But she said that one of her sons burned all of her late husband's documents, and as a result, she gets nothing.

## Koera Pradhan

Koera Pradhan estimated he was 85 years old, but he has only been at the home for the past five. He told us he learned of the home while begging in a train station in Uttar Pradesh, India's least developed state. He reckoned that he hadn't lived at home for over 50 years. He left because he was told having a father with leprosy would deprive his sons of their future. While asking him our standard set of questions: do you have Aadhaar, pension, ration, bank account, he interrupted—“When I've never had any money, why would I have a bank account?”

## Prabha Devi

Prabhadevi has suffered a severe handicap for decades, according to the women who spoke to us on her behalf. It had severely limited her mobility. Despite this, she would still spend her days on the street, begging. Only recently, they said, had she slipped and broken her hip. She is now effectively paraplegic; she can no longer walk. She does not live at the old age home. She lives alone, and relies on the community to live. They help feed, clothe, and bathe her. Her only source of income now is a government pension of 350 rupees per month, or 5 USD US dollars.
