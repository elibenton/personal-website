  I have been sitting on this most recent post for the past week, unsure of how to discuss my experience at Kauwa Kunda. The community is largely comprised of people with leprosy who have been ostracized from their homes. They were kind, patient, and open with me—and all I can feel is shame.

Kauwa Kunda is a small community on the outskirts of Raigarh in Northern Chhattisgarh. It is populated largely by people with leprosy. The community is on government land. There is an old age home for those lucky enough to gain admittance. But most residents live across the river, connected by only a single bridge, isolated in dismal conditions. Outcast from their homes, but unable to purchase the land they currently live on, they are forced into limbo--unrecognized by society and government alike. Despite the circumstances, Vipul and I actually had a very pleasant day talking with them, until one woman's question sent me spiraling, questioning everything I have done so far this year.

## Lakshmi Bai

Lakshmi Bai estimated she was over 80. She did not have leprosy, but had been cast out by her two sons and four daughters all the same. Her husband had been a _Patwari,_ a government accountant with the Revenue Department where they lived. As such, she should have been entitled to a "government family" pension when he died—which is far greater the standard retirement pension, itself only 5 USD a month. But she said that one of her sons burned all of her late husband's documents, and as a result, she gets nothing.

## Koera Pradhan

Koera Pradhan estimated he was 85 years old, but he has only been at the home for the past five. He told us he learned of the home while begging in a train station in Uttar Pradesh, India's least developed state. He reckoned that he hadn't lived at home for over 50 years. He left because he was told having a father with leprosy would deprive his sons of their future. While asking him our standard set of questions: do you have Aadhaar, pension, ration, bank account, he interrupted—“When I've never had any money, why would I have a bank account?”

## Prabha Devi

Prabhadevi has suffered a severe handicap for decades, according to the women who spoke to us on her behalf. It had severely limited her mobility. Despite this, she would still spend her days on the street, begging. Only recently, they said, had she slipped and broken her hip. She is now effectively paraplegic; she can no longer walk. She does not live at the old age home. She lives alone, and relies on the community to live. They help feed, clothe, and bathe her. Her only source of income now is a government pension of 350 rupees per month, or 5 USD US dollars.

## Reflection

I still haven't figured out how to process my day sitting across from Lakshmi, Koera, and Prabha. There was no ready made packaging to aid my understanding, no authority figure to lead a "debrief session." There weren't going to be any modules for "unpacking caste and class in contemporary India." There wasn't even a friend to turn to and say, "What the fuck, man!?" For Vipul, helping people in abject poverty who have been abandoned by their entire families is just called "Tuesday." His preternatural repose defined everything he did. In other words, he was solid as a rock.

So for the most part, I just tried to act like him: composed, almost nonchalant. We listened, noted relevant details, deduced the situation, and went on our way. The whole thing almost felt...normal, especially at the old age home where everyone went to great length to make us feel welcome. Nobody demanded to know what the hell I was doing there. We were offered lunch. Some one asked if I was married. The _idea_ I had for us being there—ensuring the condemned and forgotten were protected by the government—and the _substance_ of what we were actually doing—chatting pleasantly over lunch—left me very confused. The normalcy of the situation felt incredibly abnormal, with one exception.

We had been brought to a women's house who we'd been told was having trouble with her ration. We never got her name because the second we arrived, more and more women began congregating. Quickly a group of almost ten had gathered, all vying for Vipul's attention. He was diligently asking them questions, translating their responses to me—which was beginning to feel like a more and more useless task after every sentence. He began translating in paraphrase, then not at all. It was just taking too long.

After a few hectic minutes, the initial woman quieted everyone, looked squarely at Vipul, and made one emphatic statement. While he had just talked in Hindi for almost ten minutes, this time he translated immediately, directly, and—I assume—in full.

"She said, 'What can you do to help us?'"

I blanked—trying to parse her words for what they were truly demanding of me. I looked desperately at Vipul, then back at the woman, then back at Vipul.

She continued, and Vipul translated in quick succession: people come here all the time, ask us questions, write in notebooks, and leave. Nothing ever changes.

What was I to say to that?

## Reflection

Until that moment, I had yet to feel "bad," as one would perhaps think typical of hearing such sad stories all day. I think this was because I had convinced myself I was there to do a job. A good job narrows my mind, breeds purpose from confusion, allows me to abstract myself _away_ from the actual world in front of me.

When I was in college, I even had a routine with certain friends. If any of them were coming to me for consolation—be it romantic, academic, or generalized anxiety (all three far too common at Pomona)—I would actually ask upfront, "do you want me to listen for solutions or do you just want me to listen to listen?" Essentially, are you coming to me to make a game plan or just to know some one is here for you?

Not that the two are mutually exclusive, but sometimes I did find myself suppressing the urge to empathize—specifically to help coax my peers out of their own misery. In a way, I thought my _lack of feeling_ could be an advantage. If I felt their sadness with the same intensity they did, I wouldn't be able to do anything about it. It was my job to stay resolute and try to bring them up with me.

This whole paradigm has worked relatively well for the past three years, but it toppled like cardboard cutout in the face of this woman's question. She didn't want option one; my empathy was of no use to her. She wanted option two, she demanded to know what I would _do._ But option two—the doing—I could no longer provide.

I can help people navigate the smothering demands of hyper-competitive college life. I can help people recover from imposter syndrome so sever that it's driven them into depression. I can help people whose first forays into love have ended in equal pain. I know these things; I've lived them; they are part of me today.

I know nothing of hunger, or illness, or material want of any kind. I do not know how to win government redress or fight for that which I am supposed to be entitled. My life has been defined by entitlement. I have been entitled to the world—quite literally an all-expenses-paid trip around the globe.

## Saving the world

Of course, this is all somewhat obvious and unremarkable. Very few people can empathize with those living on five dollars a month. Additionally, it has never been my job to solve the problems of the world. There's no fine print in the Watson Fellowship that stipulates world-saving. So why do I feel so strongly otherwise?

It's a mindset I have been developing for some time, a series of mental jumping jacks that I've learned to perform, to justify that perennial question, "What have I done to deserve this?" Because my _this_ is pretty good: spending a lifetime exclusively in private education, traveling to every continent before I could drink beer, simply being in a world that (over)values my potential just by virtue of the way I look: white, male, able-bodied... you can guess the rest. What have I done to deserve _any_ of this when 99% of people have _none_ of this.

But, of course. The answer is simple. I have a job to do. I have a job—details to be determined but whose moral thrust is crystal clear—to help people; to give back; to leave the world better than I found it. In essence, I've only been able to come to terms with my privilege by promising myself something useful would come of it. Hence, the job to do. Hence, the world-saving fine print.

The woman's question took my pained mental model and laid bare the stark reality. I was not—really I _could_ not—help them. The only person who would benefit from my being there was me. I wanted to apologize profusely, put my backpack over my head, or just run. The way the woman looked at me was the way I'm sure she's looked at so many who have come to Kauwa Kunda with a notebook and good intentions. She looked disappointed. Like a surgeon suturing a wound, but in reverse; her gaze sliced through the delicate seems of my self-justification. The hypocrisy deep within was put on display for all to inspect.
