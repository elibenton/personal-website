description: >-
  A project stemming from Aimee Bahng’s Gender and Women’s Studies class, in
  this bonus episode, Lucy Gold, August Khan, and myself look into derogatory
  language. More specifically, we want to see how offensive words are
  complicated by the process of “reclaiming language,” or the re-association of
  typically demeaning words to empowering affirmations or even signals of
  solidarity and belonging.
