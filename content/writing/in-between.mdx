  "In Between" is a chronologically nonlinear soundscape, created from the “dead moments” of recorded interviews I have conducted over the past three years. I reassembled these lost snippets of conversation—none of which were included in initial broadcasts—to reconsider those moments I had previously overlooked.

### Liner Notes

#### **Published:** Claremont, CA, USA (April 2019)

#### **Remixed:** Bangalore, India (August 2019)

This piece was first made for Electronic Music Studio, a Pomona College music class. The conversations took place in Birmingham and Los Angeles. The opening sound is taken from the [THX inspired "Choose Your Weapon,"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6WrSzPQrYOaRU5I2f1ascP?si=uuOH7OuJSued6t5nfaFetQ) the first track on Hiatus Kaiyote's 2015 album of the same name. The ambiance was recorded on a rainy February day at the Claremont Colleges. The tracks were mixed, filtered, and delayed in Logic Pro X.

The title hopes to convey a double meaning. In each conversation, the moments selected occurred "in between" those which were the initial focus. The moment in between turning on the mic and asking the first question. The moment between a cathartic outburst and moving on with ones day. The moment between waking up and walking into class.

"In-between" is also a concept taken up by 20th century German political theorist, Hannah Arendt, who argued that all politics is about what lies "in between." What is between citizens when they act with, or upon, one another. Or what lies between truth and storytelling when engaging in speech. She conceptualized this gap in many ways.

> "To live together in the world means essentially that a world of things is between those who have it in common, as a table is located between those who sit around it; the world, like every in-between, relates and separates men at the same time."

In this sense, I went searching for those moments of both _relation_ and _separation_, the moments when I felt close to, or far away from, the people and places around me.
