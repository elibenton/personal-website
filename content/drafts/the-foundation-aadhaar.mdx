description: >-
  In 2009, the Indian government embarked on a wildly ambitious project: provide all 1.2 billion Indians with their own digital ID. Crazier still, they did so when only 10% of the population was connected to the internet. The solution at the time seemed so elegant, almost providential. Link the ID to something everybody already has—themselves. One decade, and one billion enrollees later, the state of Aadhaar is far more complicated.

## What It Is

<p></p>

<div>
Aadhaar is India's Social Security number, kind of. There are two main differences. First, Social Security is almost 85 years old; Aadhaar is 10. Second, Social Security is, by definition, a social insurance program, and morphed into the "de facto" national ID. Aadhaar, though initially an opt-in program, has now become mandatory for just about everything. Here's a non-exhaustive list: bank accounts, tax filings, food rations, crop subsidies, college scholarships, mobile SIM cards, train tickets, school meal programs, etc. The national government uses Aadhaar, the state governments do, private companies (even though its not clear if they are supposed to),{" "}

Simply put by internet privacy advocate Kiran Jonnalagadda in 2017, "Aadhaar has become a hammer in the hands of central government that makes every problem look like a nail." Despite legal challenges all the way up to the Supreme Court, that sentiment remains entirely true. And the aggressive
expansion has worked.

There sheer scale and speed of Aadhaar's ascendence is impressive, but as with any change so broad and rapid, controversy soon follows. Over the past decade, the program really has captured the country's political conscious precisely because it encapsulates such promise and peril at the same time. The word Aadhaar means "foundation" in Hindi, which perhaps makes sense. Replacing any foundation is always bound to make waves.

For example, Aadhaar undergirds India's Unified Payment Interface (UPI), a sophisticated system of digital payment protocols, which has enabled a cashless economy here in India that is years ahead of the United States.

Then, on the other hand, Aadhaar has been ravaged by data management that can be called careless at best, and some see as downright deceitful. For instance, despite government claims that the central repository of unique ID numbers has never been breached,{" "}

  investigative journalists and academics across the country have claimed that
  the system may have leaked the data of almost each of the 1.2 billion users.
</Citation>

Aadhaar is the archetype of technology as a "double-edged sword." Similar to how social media was utilized by both democratic activists in Tunis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, or how nuclear fission is both carbon neutral and has left the globe victim to annihilation in mere minutes. Aadhaar is a tool, which restructures the capabilities of those who use it. Labeling it merely "good" or "bad" is missing the point. Over the coming months, I hope to better understand how all actors—the government, private companies, urbanites, indigenous groups, to name a few—use the technology (or have the tech used on them).

## How It Came To Be

    I learned about Jonnalagadda after I read his famed Medium post "A Rant on Aadhaar."
  </Citation>

It is full of gems such as:

> You may be composed of flesh and blood, but Aadhaar is an electronic system that only receives bits over the wire. A fingerprint scanner turns fingers into bits—bits that can be copied and replayed any number of times, for the rest of your life, and there’s absolutely nothing you can do to stop it.

Jonnalagadda's "rant" comes off more like teatime pleasantries, starting his "tirades" with "I do not doubt their sincerity or integrity" and "This section is a long tangent, but it’s a relevant insight, so bear with me." He's similar in real life—earnest, if not entirely self-aware.

  </Citation>{" "}That is not to say the conversation itself was entirely comfortable. He
introduced himself with eyes averted and looked to the ground more often than
looking to me.

</div>

He "renaissance man," qualities showed through immediately, which further convinced me he never ranted, typically defined, about much of anything. Such rage requires too much certainty. He did recommend multiple books during our conversation, one of which is about how Indian's have proven their identity over the centuries. In response, I offered him a talk given by one of my favorite academics, Jill Lepore, on the history of evidence.

When we randomly bumped into each other at a book store just yesterday, he had already watched the talk and discussed it with his colleagues. "It works as a provocation... but this thesis is immensely weak (and Eurocentric to boot)," was one of his colleague's take.

Jonnalagadda thinks before he speaks. When I finished a question, he often did not respond. The conversation wouldn't just lull; it would halt. I did not count the length of these silences, but they were long enough for me to wonder if I should be counting. After speaking for over half an hour, we began locking eyes more frequently. When he did animate fully, I knew then it was because we were finally on the same page, not because business school had conditioned him to maintain eye contact, nod affirmatively, and shake three times. I don’t think we shook hands, actually.

<div>
At first, Jonnalagadda spoke plaintively of Aadhaar, like one might of a family member fallen on hard times. Perhaps that was because he made Aadhaar before Aadhaar existed. It was here in Karnataka, in 2006, that Jonnalagadda helped start Project Nemmadi,{" "}

</Citation> Nemmadi means "peace of mind" in Kannada, the official language of Karnataka, the state I and Jonnalagadda currently reside, and the idea was simple: provide internet-enabled centers where local residents could obtain authorized copies of their identifying documents directly from the government. "We're democratizing information services" and "We're making government better," Comat's CEO Sriram Raghavan insisted at the time.

</div>

By Jonnalagadda's estimation, the project failed. I asked him what had happened. “The administrators, they got beaten up,” he said, “There were angry mobs. They got attacked.” Comat has long been defunct. “Why?” I asked. The answer to that was very simple and also impossible to explain.

Simply put, the system didn’t work. But who was to blame, Jonnalagadda explained, it was impossible to know. “Like a football game,” he said. I grew up playing football (soccer) and when we lost, it was easiest to blame the goalkeeper. After all, he was the last person the ball passed before the goal. But Jonnalagadda is right, a game of soccer has infinite complexity. Singling out _the_ determining mistake would be like pulling out a single strand from a rubber band ball. We actually talked a lot about mistakes.

“We can’t afford to keep learning about our failures,” he said.

_“Can’t?”_ I had to clarify.

“Of course not. With each failure, some one is getting hurt.”

I paused a beat. The conversation had un-synced. He was saying something so simple, so utterly true, yet I—along with the Silicon Valley techno-optimists, the invincible Wall Street executives, and the "Human Centered Design" gurus all seem to have forgotten. Failure is good? Perhaps only when you're not the one cleaning up the mess.

## Where It's Going

Aadhaar raises fascinating questions about what should be public and what should be private in our bold, new digital age.
