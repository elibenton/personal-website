## Description

On October 4th of this year, Pomona College’s Dean of Students sent an email banning the use of anonymously-created lists that kept students out of campus events. Some people were furious, others were relieved, and many students were learning about the practice for the first time. Though many specifics about these lists remain unknown—how long the practice had been in place, how many groups were using such lists, or how many names had actually been submitted—moral stances on “The Lists” became one of the most salient conversation in campus politics. The practice was first implemented so that survivors of sexual assault could name their perpetrator and prevent them from being at the same gathering, without fear of retaliation. Critics, and ultimately the Pomona administration, seemed to fear these lists could be used for more insidious purposes as well. To start off this four part series on “The Lists”, we try to learn from students what they were, why they were made, and if they are really so different from practices that have existed outside the Claremont bubble for some time.

## Reflection

After a bit of a tumultuous beginning of the school year in terms of finding how I would consistently produce my podcast, I finally decided to go it alone and officially make it part of my thesis. This process alone taught me much. Partnerships—either with other students, with campus organizations, or even with employers who pay you—can be a blessing and a curse. After each one of these avenues fell through, I cam to the realization that even though my vision was a new conduit for discussion, the ways in which I wanted to approach it were singular enough that I would need to produce the podcast on my own.

By that point, the topic that seemed to have the most buzz on campus was the use of anonymized online lists to manage guest entry into campus events. Though the practice has been known to occur for almost five years, most of the time it was relegated to private gatherings of friends who did not publicize their practice. This semester, however, seemingly every Facebook event openly invited submissions at the bottom of their description. It did not take long until the administration took notice, precipitating the first of many all school emails which would throw the student body into anger and unrest.

I did not know at the time that my pursuit of this topic would become the overriding thrust of DisCo. I have learned of myself that I am terrible at self-imposed deadlines and closure. I always prioritize the unanswered questions—and sometimes even the unasked questions—over brevity and consistency. Maybe this means I am better suited for longford reporting. Maybe this means I need to be more self-disciplined. My hunch is somewhat of both.

This topic quickly proved to be one that individuals wanted to talk about least, and I think that, in part, may have been the attraction for me. It was something that everyone thought about, but few were comfortable talking about openly. “The lists” were the archetypal example; a deeply divisive topic that was almost never discussed in public. There was the fact that the simple reporting of the facts was harder than most topics. It would have been inappropriate for me to seek our survivors of sexual assault and proposition them for their stories. Similarly, the only way to find some one on a list was advertising myself as open to conversation and hoping they would identify themselves to me. The topic was perhaps the most shrouded in secrecy I could have selected.

The decision would ultimately reduce the quantity of episodes produced, but I believe it greatly challenged, and thus expanded, my ability to report thoughtfully on topics for which that is hardest to do.
