- Digital India: "I didn't think my investigation of the internet would lead me to
  the remote mountain towns of India, to a place where people walk for five
  kilometers just to find a road, a place where the government ships in rice
  because, if it rains, making it to the weekly market becomes impossible. But
  the location actually makes perfect sense. To investigate the networked world,
  one follows the network—and here, the network was perfect.

  The discrepancy between India's physical and digital infrastructure boggles my
  mind. Here, public sanitation is still a political concern of the highest
  priority, but mobile broadband is so passé it's only three US cents per
  gigabyte. Nandan Nilekani, sometimes called “The CEO of India,” has said the
  country will be “data rich before it'll be economically rich.” He would know.

  Creator of Aadhaar, the world's largest biometric-based ID system, Nilekani
  conjured 1.2 billion new data points by digitizing the second largest
  population in the world. In recent years, Aadhaar has faced mounting criticism
  from privacy activists, civil society groups, and the Supreme Court, but it
  has not tempered the Aadhaar fever. The High Court of Tamil Nadu recommended
  Aadhaar be linked to Facebook to fight fake news. The Excise Department of
  Karnataka considered requiring the ID to purchase alcohol, to cut down on
  litter.

  Nothing appears off limits in India's digital experiment, even under
  unfavorable conditions--a still developing economy, massive cultural and
  linguistic diversity, and almost no digital literacy. People here say, “If it
  works it India, it could be the next global standard.” The globe might want to
  start paying attention."

- Title IX Today: "Pomona College, like most elite liberal arts universities across
  the country, is a hotbed for student activism and political dissent. But there
  was one cry that rose above the rest during the college’s 126ᵗʰ academic
  year--end sexual violence.

  It began as year of firsts and ended in mostly retractions. For the first
  time, students openly banned accused assailants from campus gatherings,
  invoking accusations of “blacklists” and vigilante justice. Half a year later,
  the Pomona administration disbanded The Advocates for Survivors of Sexual
  Assault, the student group tasked with helping victims navigate their process
  of recovery, prompting a new wave of outrage and furthering resolve that
  students alone had to solve this problem.

  The backdrop to it all was Title IX, the 1972 law barring sex discrimination
  on college campuses that is being systematically dismantled by Education
  Secretary Betsy Devos. These legal uncertainties—stemming from both executive
  orders and court rulings—forced the college to make hasty decisions, which
  were only explained in vague, circumspect language. This, of course,
  compounded the already volatile situation.

  This three part series tried to make sense of the events in real time,
  bringing to the fore voices of student activists, college administrators, and
  even accused perpetrators. Here is a window into one college's ongoing battle
  to end sexual assault."
