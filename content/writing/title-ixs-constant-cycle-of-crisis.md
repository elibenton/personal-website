On February 13th of this year, The Pomona College Advocates for Survivors of Sexual Assault, the 15 year old peer-to-peer support program, was unilaterally disbanded by the Pomona Administration. Though the program is slated to be reinstated in the coming school year, many questions remain. Why exactly did they need to be disbanded immediately? When they are reinstated, what form will the program take? Why weren't the advocates given forewarning? The decision felt drastic, and without clarity around the impetus behind the choice, left many students confused and angry.

But when viewed in context of the last decade of Claremont's constant cycle of crisis around Title IX, the decision feels more inevitable than unprecedented. Pomona College’s President’s Advisory Committee on Sexual Violence Intervention and Prevention, or PAC-SVIP, it is the third working group to revise Pomona's Title IX policy in just six years. Three of the five colleges have been named in investigations filed by the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights. These are the kinds of investigations where if the federal government believed the colleges weren't complying, they could pull federal funding. Since Dear Colleague, the Claremont College's have been sued by students on eight separate times. That's a lawsuit a year, and some of them are still being appealed. For the third installment of our series on Sexual Assault at the Claremont Colleges, we're a simple question without any straightforward answer: how did we get here?

## Reflection

This episode was the hardest to produce. As you see in the transcript immediately, the topic that I was trying to cover—the disbanding of the advocates—occurred on February 13th. I was unable to release the episode until April 2nd. The main essence I was attempting to capture was this: the disbanding of the advocates felt unprecedented. I, nor any other student, could have foreseen it happening. But I also had done enough reporting to have a sense that the contours of the Title IX debate changed drastically and rapidly. I wanted to know just how big of a development this was in the context of the history around sexual assault, from a national political and campus organization perspective. I ended believing the exact opposite. The disbanding didn’t feel unprecedented; it felt inevitable.

It felt like a revelation almost as important as talking to the person who had been one of the lists the semester before. I made an interactive spreadsheet with over 40 different developments in the understanding of Title IX to accompany the episode. I attempted a miniature civics lesson on how the law had come to be understood in each branch of government. I highlighted sensational aspects to draw attention, like how Pomona and CMC are still tied in litigation from a botched Title IX case my first year at Pomona.

Nothing stuck. Once again, without a far more persistent advertising conduit, no one was willing to sacrifice the half hour to attempt to follow my circuitous journey to a new conception about the law. Inevitably, this was a disappointment, but not enough to lead me to begin online advertisement. I maintain a conviction that such an effort would indeed increase the number of “click throughs” to my page, but would have increased the number of people who fully engaged with my episodes by almost none. Clicking on a link while scrolling through Facebook is not a posture of commitment and critical thought, the stance I still believe listeners would need to make it through my (often contradictory and at times even unclear) three part series on the topic.
