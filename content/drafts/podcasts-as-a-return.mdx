  Contrary to some pundits, the problems of journalism existed long before Donald Trump’s presidency or the invention of the internet. These problems were present from the very beginning. I do not mean to imply we should “restore journalism” to a constructed past that never actually existed. Rather, we should acknowledge that how we understand the past has bearing on the present, and it can, in some capacity, even provide insight for the future.

Reading Rebecca Mead’s November 19, 2019 New Yorker article “Binge Listening,” I stepped away with an uncanny sense that podcasting was significant in ways previously unconsidered. Weeks later, while retrieving the story online for use in this thesis, I was—in a bout of beautiful irony—prompted to listen to it instead.

The company Curio is following with an identical business model, just with a different set of publishers. The firm Luminary is jumping into the mix this summer, offering an add-free subscription service akin to the “Netflix of podcasting.” Swedish music streaming service Spotify decided to go all in on podcasts this year, purchasing distribution platform Anchor and the independent production company Gimlet. Podcasting insiders seem to believe the buyout of Gimlet solidified a bright future for the medium.

Business is good for podcasters, and at a surface level, that is good indication of on-demand audio’s current appeal. Due to the now nominal price of equipment and ease of setting up distribution channels, the barrier to entry for podcasting has all but vanished. Just about anyone can sit behind a microphone, start talking, and assemble some subset of people who will listen. But the medium of podcasting has both more broad-based and complex implications for today’s politics. Those implications extend far beyond the latest capital flows or acquisition strategies, because as cutting-edge as podcasting may seem, it is — in most ways — a return. Specifically, podcasting is a return to narrative form, a return to the spoken word, and a retreat from technology.

Considered on this scale, the significance of podcasting is not that the former Obama staff led start-up Crooked Media is turning their back on venture capital money. Individual success stories abound, but I am more interested in the implicit arguments of podcasting: what it means to make a podcast rather than write an article; what it means to listen rather than read; what it means that we silently ride the subway everyday with disembodied voices speaking directly into our brain. Marshall McLuhan famously argued that “The medium is the message.” Some of his examples are as arcane as clothing, clocks, and light bulbs. In all of our objects, McLuhan believed there were inherent arguments about capacity and scale. Podcasting viewed in this light, brings forth a whole continuum of new questions.

Such a continuum can be extremely daunting; I do not postulate a new theory of democracy every time I listen to The New York Times “The Daily.” Broad questions are ever-present, but sometimes the best way to initiate inquiry is through engaging tiny slices rather that postulate the whole thing. Sometimes, broader concepts only come into focus in relief against individual, even unimportant, moments. So I set out to capture the specifics too. I made my own podcast, and it has taught me as much as my reading. The show is called The Discussion Collective, or as I once thought was a stroke of pure genius, DisCo. I first had the idea for The Discussion Collective walking through the streets of Washington, D.C. in the fall of 2017. I had just finished a class at the Claremont McKenna semester in Washington program. Departing our office suite on 17th and L and beginning the evening’s short walk back to my apartment in Chinatown, I found myself unable to engage my housemates walking alongside me.

All they could talk about was how angry class had left them, how incensed they were at those with whom they had been arguing, how stupid the points people were making had been. The debate was—by all standard metrics—a resounding success: provocative points, biting counterpoints, heated gesticulations, off-the-cuff citations, invocation of famous quotes. In fact, the debate may have been the best in class yet. And I was confident nothing had been transferred between the participants; no understanding, no meaning, maybe not even remembrance of words exchanged. I had soured on debate. Turning onto Massachusetts Avenue two blocks before our apartment, I told my housemates I was stopping at the grocery store for a late night snack, but once I rounded the block I headed due south for the Capital Mall where I wondered aimlessly for the next few hours, rambling away into my phone’s voice recorder, trying to articulate what would eventually become DisCo’s mission statement. I did not make it home until 1am.

> Equal parts skeptical and vulnerable, The Discussion Collective, or DisCo, is a podcast meant to question life at the Claremont Colleges by having the conversations that we typically avoid. With an understanding that the personal and political are deeply intertwined, DisCo combines one-on-one interviews, panel discussions, and audio storytelling to open up campus issues, and consider broader political movements as they relate to our undergraduate lives.

> It's all premised on the idea that a good discussion really only demands one thing: we accept the possibility of being wrong. With DisCo, I want to acknowledge the limitation of my own positions. Instead of proving a point, I want to advocate for the process of discussion itself. The difficulty of translating ideas into words, the tension in respectful disagreements, and the discomfort of asking candid questions. I believe these experiences have inherent value, separate from proving our own intellect or changing the minds of people around us.

> This isn't an easy thing to do, though, and it requires a constant dedication to specific techniques: separation of person from their position, charitable interpretation of opposing arguments, and a healthy dose of old fashioned listening. By doing this, I hope DisCo can become a place where members of the Claremont community—students, faculty, and guests—can practice these techniques among encouraging and invested peers. And I'm not using any fancy metrics to measure success. I just hope to encourage us all to have more frequent, respectful, and insightful conversations of our own.

That idea existed almost six months before the first episode was released. In perhaps a strange inversion of normal “founding narratives,” I was sure of the tone long before the topic. The topic, eventually, became the intersection of campus and national politics. But I remain firm in belief that determining what an entire show “is about” is a somewhat foolish task. What a show is about is just a crude amalgamation of what each episode is about, which are themselves just a collection of interviews, which themselves are just a series of question and answer. Each of those contain not only specific ideas, phrases, and words, but also belying intonation, divulging body language, and most importantly, silences. Silences can say as much as the words in between them. If politics is about how individuals assemble into collectives, how pieces relate to their wholes, making a podcast often felt like much the same endeavor.

## The Current Problem

Without a doubt, this project was motivated by the ascendance of President Donald Trump. I took my first course in politics at Pomona College, “Campaigns and Elections,” during the Fall of 2016. The class was taught Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The first person I saw after the most surprising Tuesday night of my life was my professor. 48 hours earlier, he had promised what had happened could not possibly come to be. His truth had failed us all, he said, and apologized, holding back tears. My politics will be defined by the 2016 election, by the line between possible and impossible being completely erased, by total skepticism and uncertainty.

While writing this thesis—though this may reveal the depth of my concern for our current situation—I took great solace that these authors did not seem to agree on the aims and methods of the news. Questions of what is evidence or opinion, information or storytelling, and fact or fiction abound. Saturated in past battles of thought, I was able to hold out hope that today’s political landscape may not be as unprecedented as it sometimes feels.

If there was one unequivocal truth to be deduced from reading exclusively about journalism for a year, it was this: 2019 is not the field's first crisis. I take small solace that in 2004, Karl Rove told journalist Ron Suskind that politicians no longer live in the “reality-based community.” I was darkly reassured that the “Pentagon Papers” revealed the incredible extent of the “credibility gap” between Johnson’s and Nixon’s administrations and the American public during the Vietnam War. I was actually happy to read from Walter Lippmann’s 1922 book Public Opinion that newspapers “cannot produce the amount of knowledge which the democratic theory of public opinion demands.” None of these proclamations are uplifting, but they give the current tumult an antecedent. They show, at the very least, we kept on going. Furthermore, if we are to give equal credence to these historical fights over truth, the most useful premise may be that truth does not exist. That is to say, seemingly the only point of agreement between these authors was that defining a singular, “capital-T” truth was at best, futile, and at worst, dangerous. This is undoubtedly a daunting notion, but “post-truth” seems to be the go-to lamentation of our time.

I too worry what a politics without truth may look like, but not for the reasons some might. We do find ourselves with a president who makes a statement on Monday just to lie about it Tuesday, a military who impersonates clerics on social media to incite ethnic cleansing, and a family who fabricates science to conceal the lethality of the drugs they sell. Some, like literary critic Michiko Kakutani, point to these instances and blame those at the end of the 20th who supposedly played fast and loose with the truth. “Postmodernist arguments deny an objective reality existing independently from human perception, contending that knowledge is filtered through the prisms of class, race, gender, and other variables.” She then situates the postmoderns in opposition to everyone else, the Enlightenment, Christianity, Marxism, and even the Scientific method. To a degree, she might be right, but the question becomes: were postmodernist challenging such structures for the sake of it—to hell with the consequence—or because they were actual contentions to be had? Kakutani seems to believe the former. “Postmodernist arguments would clear the way for today’s anti-vaxxers and global warming deniers, who refuse to accept the consensus opinion of the overwhelming majority of scientists.”

To be clear, the President’s tweeting, sectarian Buddhist cleric’s hatred, and the Sackler family’s callous enrichment should not be mistaken for post-truth. Even when grafters and charlatans like Mike Cernovich, the alt-right conspiracy theorist, invoke postmodern theory—“I don’t seem like a guy who reads, Lacan, do I?”—that does not mean they do so correctly. These are incidents of lying, and lying, I fear, may be the least of our problems. To me, lying acknowledges the existences of something that needs to be obscured, something that—if revealed—would likely lead to agreement. The solution to “post-truth” is not as simple as building consensus on how to deal with liars.

The solution cannot be that simple because the problems are far more fundamental and systemic. Here, I use the word “systemic” to invoke theoretical systems of politics more so than material systems of government. How to adjudicate challenges to libel law, legislate public interest standards for media organizations, or find a sustainable revenue model for journalism are all questions of extreme urgency and importance, but they are not the main concern of this thesis. My hope—though this may be naive—is that by having a better grasp on the theoretical questions that undergird more tangible problems, we can do more than implement short term solutions. We can all consider our role in the system's long-term success.

## Etymology

With those objectives in mind, I have found two methods of inquiry useful in my thinking. The first is etymology. When discussing theories of journalism, the system of language is the first to be implicated. In 1946, George Orwell warned that we “ought to recognize that the present political chaos is connected with the decay of language.” Orwell believed language was equally capable of both concealing and revealing thought. He supported the latter but feared that both malevolence and negligence were contributing to the former.

Words, being one of the building blocks of communication (along with sound, syntax, and other features when dealing with podcasts), become worthy of study and definition. 20th political theorist Hannah Arendt frequently redefined commonly understood words to make larger political arguments. One of her techniques was splitting binaries into sets of three. For instance, in The Human Condition she proposes something “very simple…nothing more than to think what we are doing” [emphasis added]. In this process she delineates doing into three distinct categories: labor, work, and action. This elegant process implicitly highlights one of the key features of words, they are often best understood in opposition what they are not. In the case of Arendt, her “very simple” idea is far more powerful than she lets on. The Human Condition was conceived out of a project called the “Totalitarian Elements of Marxism.” Arendt means to imply that Marx’s definition of labor is bloated and imprecise.

Labor is “the activity which corresponds to the biological process of the human body... The human condition of labor is life itself.” Labor is what is needed to live—eating, providing oneself the ability to eat, ensuring oneself the ability to provide for oneself, etc. Such obligations are incessant and never ending, and correspondingly, labor is cyclical and constant. Her major contention to Marx was that new means of production would beget the worker’s revolution and freeing them from the binds of labor, even though Marx earlier claimed that it was labor itself that defined humans. Arendt shows the contradictions apparent to labor’s centrality to being human.

Work, on the other hand, is “the activity which corresponds to the unnaturalness of human condition,” or the means by which humans shape nature into something unnatural. A word that might closely hue with work is craft, art, or technology, all items humans make not to survive but to turn their environment into something of their own volition. Finally Action is “the only activity that goes on directly between men without an intermediary of things or matter, corresponds to the human condition of plurality, to the fact that men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world.” If this reminds you of Arendt’s definition of politics, that’s because she thought they were the same. Action, along with speech, was the way by which individuals differentiated themselves from collective and distinguished themselves to one another.

By summoning two more words and siphoning off distinct meaning into each of them, each gains first more clarity (by defining fewer ideas), and second, more nuance (by the implicit relationship of not being the other two words). Arendt says it best: “all our definitions are distinctions…we are unable to say what anything is without distinguishing it from something else.” Ferdinand de Saussure agrees, writing, “Concepts are purely differential and defined not by their positive content but negatively by their relations with the other terms of the system. Their most precise characteristic is in being what they other are not.”

To be fair, all language is ambiguous. In English, the word that takes the prize for most ambiguous is “run.” In the next Oxford English Dictionary, it will have 645 definitions. One explanation put forward for this is the proliferation of technology: iPhones run apps, cars run on gas, you can run up your credit card. That being said, “run” is still rarely a political word outside of “running for office.” Others are in constant contestation: consent, queer, and rights, just to name a few. Beyond the definition of singular words, however, the larger political battles often arise over who can speak, and when, and which sets of words they can use when they do.

One word that desperately needs an Arendt-like treatment is “truth.” This analysis is not an attempt to redefine truth (though perhaps I once though it was). For the sake of clarity, however, there is value in delineating a number of “truth adjacent” ideas into their own distinct definitions. I will start with the difference between “truth” and “fact.” American philosopher John Dewey wrote in 1927, “Many persons seem to suppose that facts carry their meaning along with themselves on their face. Accumulate enough of them, and their interpretation stares out at you… But the power of physical facts to coerce belief does not reside in bare phenomena. It proceeds from method.” He then goes on to describe methods of verification, assemblage, and interpretation.

This concept aligns well with the one offered by current historian Jill Lepore, who argues that the American concept of truth never really existed either, as if waiting to be found. It has to be constructed—deconstructed, and reconstructed again, continuously. In 2019, this is the crucial notion that seems to be eroding: we ourselves must agree upon patterns, procedures, and even codified rules of how truth is to be made. Kovach and Rosenstiel write in their seminal work on journalistic theory that “Truth requires commitment, a dedication to a process of verification,” calling it both the most important and least understood principle of the field. Truth is not an adherent to an impossible to define standard such as fairness or balance, but a disinterested method by which every story is approached.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Though exploring all the different analyses of the truth/fact distinction could fill three theses, I’ll generally abide to this paradigm when distinguishing between fact and truth. A fact is a faithful account of an occurrence in the real world. Facts are typically small, unambiguous, and agreed upon: the politician’s tie was red; the call came into dispatch at 2:14 AM. The truth is a process of combining, ordering, and discussing facts such as to create broader understanding. Walter Lippmann said in Public Opinion, “if each fact and each relation had a name that was unique, and if everyone agreed on the names, it would be possible to communicate without misunderstanding.” This statement both concedes the unambiguity of fact and the difficulty of moving from a “set of facts” to “the truth.” I see truth as the naming of facts and relations. It is in no way arbitrary, but there also exist a multiplicity of methods by which to proceed. Attention to and consistency in such a process is what distinguishes truth from falsity.

## Epistemology

The second method useful for this analysis is epistemology. This “knowledge about knowledge” feels to me like a critical intervention in today's news media landscape. We no longer know how we know what we do. Ideas, and our capacity to transfer them among one another, has taken on an additional relevance today thanks to incredible technological advances. Arendt also writes in The Human Condition, “the ‘truths’ of the modern scientific world view, though they can be demonstrated in mathematical formulas and proved technologically, will no longer lend themselves to normal expression in speech and thought.” She wrote wearily of this world in which we were “unable to understand, that is to think and speak, about things which nevertheless we were able to do.” James Bridle, writing today about the relentless advancement of technology, is even more alarmed: “Software is unable to distinguish between its model of the world and reality—and, once conditioned, neither are we.” If we no longer know how we know, how can we act responsibly on that which we do know?

To make these questions more concrete, I will briefly consider the example of Twitter. When it comes to Twitter, I am less concerned than most that Russian robots impersonating people. I am more concerned that we cannot collectively decide the role of Twitter in political conversation to begin with. Were we to be able to agree on the role of Twitter in politics—removing bots would seem to me a relatively simple task. I am also concerned that we insist all non-bot Twitter account are themselves “real.” Yes, they are operated by humans, but is the ecosystem of Twitter not a powerful and coercive artifice in and of itself. I am appalled that we have come to believe that political discussion in faceless, 50-word increments is no different than a conversation with speech and eye contact. I am then most trouble that despite engaging almost exclusively in the Twitter’s algorithmically reified political silos, that when we do have (the now rarified) cross-cutting discussion, we refuse to think our habituation online will not re-affect person-to-person discourse.

We should reasonably assume that slight perversions of fact transpire every time an occurrence is recorded, transported, and, ultimately, interpreted between individuals. But my concern is that the systems by which this happens, primarily mediated by technology, are becoming both more drastic and obscure. In some ways, we have to confront the issue head on; we must remember that, as Lewis Lapham says, “all news is fake.” Fake in the sense of being fabricated, constructed, “not what happened yesterday; a story about what happened yesterday.” Like a ridiculously high-stakes game of telephone with seventeen intermediaries, the modern news media is responsible for facilitating what we know about American politics. The news is the epistemological aspect of politics; it is how we know what we know.

Just as no journalist’s copy is ever without some degree of bias (at the very least, bias of omission and simplification), no data point can account for all features of the item measured. When we forget this, every subsequent decision is liable to that initial oversight. Lippmann defined “fiction” not as a lie, but a “representation of the environment which is in lesser or greater degree made by man himself.” For Lippmann, all fiction had some fidelity to fact. As long as the degree of fidelity could be taken into account, fiction was a perfectly workable standard. In fact, he believed fiction was all we had.

Contrary to some pundits, the problems of journalism existed long before Donald Trump’s presidency or the invention of the internet. These problems were present from the very beginning; in many ways, they are inherent. So when I say, “podcasting is a return,” I do not mean to imply we should “restore journalism” to a constructed past that never actually existed. This thesis does not peddle in nostalgia, the blind belief that the past was better than the present. It more closely hues to historicism, which—though a contentious term in its own right—at the very least, acknowledges that how we understand the past has bearing on the present, and it can, in limited capacity, provide insight for the future.
