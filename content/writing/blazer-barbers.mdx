Inside the team’s new locker room, there’s a barber pole. Once the chair arrives, that corner of the locker room will become the team’s barbershop. Linebacker Tevin Crews and Michael Turner, a quarterback, know how to use scissors and clippers. They say between classes and practice, players don’t have a lot of time for haircuts. Having it done in-house by one of their own means players save time and money.
