  Today, I write my first "listicle," a truly genius form. Taking other people's content, repackaging it with the hottest "hot takes" and serving it back to you,  lukewarm. Here’s a small window into my thinking through books, podcasts, and articles that have stuck with me over the past months. Each of these pieces has informed my current thinking here in India, even if the path was circuitous.

Hello Dear Readers!

I apologize for the email woes and delays. I really thought this Mailchimp thing was going to be more simple, _especially_ considering that they advertise it all over the podcasts I listen to! And people (like me) who listen to such podcasts are always thinking our opinions are important enough to blast through the SMTP ether. Anyway, I have heard your concerns loud and clear! So we are going to change things up a little bit.

After today's note, I’ll stop sending entire posts via email. They never appeared properly, and people couldn’t read them. Instead, every other Sunday, I’ll send out an overview of all of the posts from the past two weeks. You can browse the title, read a short description, and then click through to the blog itself if you are interested in reading the whole thing. Maybe some weeks there'll be lots to choose from! Sometimes there'll only be one. If you don't receive an email—don't fret—I'm fine. I'm just being lazy.

Rest assured, I have been busy with both work and play, but I have yet to finish those writings. Stay tuned. But I'm no fool. I know how this business works, having to placate the incessant demand for content. Publish or peril! So they say...

### [Random Family](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Random-Family/Adrian-Nicole-LeBlanc/9780743254434)

#### February 2004

Adrian Nicole LeBlanc spent well over a decade essentially living with the protagonists of _Random Family_. For years, she met with them daily, and even stayed in their homes in the Bronx, in New York City and Troy, in upstate New York.

> LeBlanc’s subjects sold drugs, did drugs, committed murder, went to prison, had sex, fell in love, got pregnant, fed their children. They shared ambitions and fears with a writer who was by their side for a decade. The book that resulted is an urban epic...
>
> Anna Altman and Katia Bachko, 2013

What makes _Random Family_ so powerful and heartbreaking is precisely the matter-a-fact manner in which it’s written. Every conceivable type of trauma, betrayal, abuse is described as just another day. The conspicuous absence of impassioned writing is far and away the loudest stylistic choice.

> That summer, Serena started to cry whenever she peed, and after a few weeks, Lourdes threatened to hit Jessica if she didn't bring Serena to the hospital to be checked. When Jessica and Elaine finally took her to the emergency room, the doctors discovered that she'd been sexually abused. She was two years old. Jessica was detained. A police officer interviewed her and explained that he could not release Serena into her custody. Lourdes had to sign for her… Lourdes blamed Jessica; Jessica blamed herself. And somehow, Serena got lost in the noise. All the women in Serena's life had been sexually abused at one time or another, and their upset seemed to be less about the child's trauma than the overwhelming need, precipitated by the crisis, to revisit their own.

Taken in isolation, each episode shocks the conscious. But when a new horror appears every paragraph, the individual scenes begins to lose their outrageous nature. As the reader, I found myself becoming as inured to the characters’ conditions as they themselves seem to be.

Then periodically, I would remember that I had never once experienced a loss remotely similar to the hundreds I had just read about. Closing the book left me with a feeling I could not fully comprehend; not like the pre-packaged outrage offered readily online, or the feel-good empathy engendered by “learning across difference.” _Random Family_ is a forced reckoning—an insistence that tragedy and hardship the likes of which I cannot conceive is real. So real—in fact—it is almost banal.

Reading about heartbreak like it is baseball stats creates is a strange disconnect. The book prompted _many_ thoughts about the theoretical elements of journalism as a medium and reporting’s complicated relationship to truth. But I need more time to understand my own thoughts there, so I’ll save that for later.

Regardless, read _Random Family_. I can’t promise exactly what you’ll take away, but it will trouble both your heart and mind.

### [Breaking News](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/breaking-news)

#### July 2017

It is safe to say that listening to “Breaking News” is when I decided on my Watson project. I was listening on a long, solo drive, somewhere between Birmingham, AL and Asheville, NC. The episode centers on what are now colloquially known as “Deep Fakes,” or digitally altered videos convincing enough that they seem real.

The entire episode is worth listening to, but the following exchange is what has stuck with me two years later. The interchange happens between the episode’s reporter, Simon Adler, and Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman a professor of computer science at The University of Washington. For context, Kemelmacher-Shlizerman develops programs that animates individual’s faces to speak any text fed into the machine.

> **SIMON:** _Like, the timing of you guys making this thing, and then this explosion of fake news. Like, how do you guys think about -- about how it could be used for nefarious purposes?_
>
> **IRA:** _Yeah, it's a good question._
>
> **…**
>
> **IRA:** _I feel like when every technology is developed, then there is this danger of with our technology, you -- you can create fake videos and so on. I don't want to call it fake videos, but like, to create video from audio, right?_
>
> **SIMON:** _But they are fake videos._
>
> **IRA KEMELMACHER-SHLIZERMAN:** _Yeah, yeah. But the way that I think about it is that, like scientists are doing their job and showing -- like, inventing the technology and showing it off, and then we all need to, like, think about the next steps, obviously. I mean, people should work on that, and the answer is not clear._
>
> **…**
>
> **SIMON:** _But like, a man in North -- I think he was from North Carolina, believed from a fake print article that Hillary Clinton was running a sex ring out of a pizza parlor in DC, which is, like, insane. This man believed it and showed up with a gun. And if people are at a moment where they are willing to believe stories as ludicrous as that, like, I don't expect them to wonder if this video is real or not._
>
> **IRA:** _So what are you asking?_
>
> **SIMON:** _I'm asking -- well, I'm asking, do you -- are you afraid of the power of this? And if not, why?_
>
> **IRA:** _Just -- I'm just giving my -- I don't know. It just -- I'm answering your questions, but I'm a technologist, I'm a computer scientist. So not really, because I know how to -- and I know that -- because I know that this technology's reversible. I mean, nobody -- well, there is not -- not worried too much._

By the middle of this exchange, I was yelling in frustration and banging my hands on the steering wheel. It felt like the perfect exemplification of a fear that had been brewing inside me ever since I started taking computer science and political science courses side-by-side.

Kemelmacher-Shlizerman was subscribing to the belief that scientists are not responsible for the way their discoveries and/or inventions are used. It struck me as both tone deaf and painfully naive. Is Facebook not responsible when it allows ethic cleansing to be carried out on its platform? Are the Sacklers not responsible for the pandemic of preventable opioid deaths across the country? Does she really believe she has no responsibility for fake news when she’s built a program designed to rewrite reality?

Then again—she might not actually. Is Albert Einstein responsible for the United State’s massacre of the Japanese with two Atomic bombs? The politics of technology is complicated, and this episode of RadioLab dives into the mess head on.

### [Neil Young’s Lonely Quest to Save Music](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/magazine/neil-young-streaming-music.html)

#### August 2019

This strange, meandering piece by Jim Goldberg won’t teach you much about Neil Young, barring fun examples of his eccentricity and irritability. It does, however, put Young’s recent escapades in the context of a larger narrative: voicing concern with the modern condition.

> But Young hears something creepier and more insidious in the new music too. We are poisoning ourselves with degraded sound, he believes, the same way that Monsanto is poisoning our food with genetically engineered seeds… Substituting smoothed-out algorithms for the contingent complexity of biological existence is bad for us, Young thinks.

The article is really not about music at all. It is about raising a new generation in a troubled new millennium. As it turns out, both Young and Goldberg have children with sensory disorders, and both have sought auditory-based treatments.

> In that moment, talking about our sons, I realized how all of Young’s obsessions fit together: They are centered in a common understanding of experience and how it shapes us. Human development is led by our senses. Our senses exert a formative and shaping pressure on our brains. So if our experience of the world around us can damage our brains and our souls, it makes a kind of intuitive sense that music can also help us feel better. Every musician, and every music fan, believes that.

Using music—and sound more broadly—as synecdoche for experience, Goldberg tries to argue that Young’s obsession with fidelity is really about preserving our humanity. What creates high fidelity sound? It’s not loud volumes, not instant streaming, not universal availability, and certainly not compression. It’s the exact opposite; the incongruences, imperfections, and inexplicable complexities.

If we allow the rest of our world to go the way of digital music, squashing all the outliers into a more comfortable range, we’ll sew the seeds of our dissatisfaction, sacrificing wonder at the altar of convenience.

> It’s strange to imagine that Young might be a prophet of sorts — but maybe not. His lesson is that everything human is shot through with imperfection. Filtering that out doesn’t make us more perfect; it is making us sick.
