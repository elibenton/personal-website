title: An Argument For Sanctuary Cities
date: 2017-11-02
city: "Claremont, CA"
country: US
description: >-
  For decades, sanctuary cities have existed for those two reasons: public safety and public trust. For those same reasons, they’ve been remarkably uncontroversial until only recently.

They are a necessary reaction — a reaction to complete failure from every branch of the Federal Government to address the crises of our immigration system.
