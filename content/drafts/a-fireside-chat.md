description: "I wrote my last post in a quiet, upscale neighborhood called Sadashivanagar on the Northern part of town. I've since moved across town into the larger, younger, and more frenetic Koramangala. I probably met north of 40 people over the weekend, even if it was only a brief introduction in bars or after events, even if main draw was learning what the hell the white person was doing showing up to the bar alone."
