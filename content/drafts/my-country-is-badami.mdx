title: My Country is Badami

city: Badami, Karnataka
country: India

  Though Badami is only 200 miles away from Bangalore, it feels like it could be it's own world. The tiny town in northern Karnataka is a quiet, religious place — centered along one main street. It is also home to some of the best sport clibing in India. Taking an overnight train each way, I spent the last week exploring Badami with a kind, funny, and impressively multi-cultural climbing gang from Bangalore.

## Getting There

![The plaform in Bangalore](../images/train.jpg)

There is something almost cinematic about trains—especially this specific train I am now on. The southwestern railway's trip from Bangalore to Badami. Everything is constructed of wrought iron, coated in off-beige paint that is chipping healthily. Massive bolts punctuate the walls and ceiling, giving the train an industrial texture worth of it's massive, churning diesel engine. Chain-link straps hang from the ceiling, covered in a wonderful and gaudy red-faux leather.

I walk down the corridor, passing sets of women in colorful Saris settling in to sleep next to women in black Hijabs. With roti, men scoop up fragrant masalas and chutneys they brought from home. The less resourceful pick at bland biriyani peddled by staff who walk up and down the isle. I am one of these less fortunate.

Between each compartment there are wash rooms and dirty sinks, but this one has soap that smells like tea leaves. My climbing companions tell me this is a rare luxury. Between compartments is also where you can open the door and lean your face out, the Indian countryside rushing by. It's getting dark and the air is cool because the rain from the past two days has puddled on the ground.

Back inside, the hanging beds are so close together that moving about requires navigating a sea of feet and elbows. Nestle into your tucked away bunk near the ceiling, however, and each compartment expands into its own self-contained world—replete with an eager cast of characters.

Across from us, there are two beds parallel to the long corridor. A young couple shares a light meal on the lower bunk. They talk in soft banter, rarely breaking eye contact except to watch the occasional video on his phone. Before too long, she climbs up and the two go to sleep.

Some characters only make brief appearances, like the ticket counter or water bottle seller. A crying baby or boisterous group elsewhere on the train can set the scene for another compartment, prompting the imagination of another world. But the low drone of the passing landscape and the steady rumble of axel and track have a tranquilizing effect, and our 10x10 compartment is the only world I care to inhabit as I gently rock to sleep.

## Sensei

In terms of my climbing, this trip was hardly my finest. I have no real excuse. The objective of climbing is painfully simple (go up) and the quality of the routes in Badami was equal to and even better than many of the locations I have climbed in the U.S. But due to the novelty of the situation, my initial lack of familiarity with the people in my group, and my lackluster training regime over the past year, I knew I would not be in top climbing form.

This problem was compounded on the first day. On my forth climb of the trip, I got nervous while attempting to clip my rope to a quickdraw (for those not acquainted with climbing, this is one of the few moments where climbers are actually putting themselves at risk). I took a fall larger than I would have preferred. I was unscathed—not even a scratch—but mentally, I was rattled. My belayer, Shwetank, could see it in my eyes as I came down from the climb.

I did not climb for the next few hours. I was humiliated. To be amongst new friends with the opportunity of a lifetime (how many get to travel across the globe to climb?), and yet, I was so timid, all I could do was sit and watch.

Luckily, I found in my climbing partners the perfect support.

Our "de facto" leader was a 35 year old menswear designer with a full beard and perfectly round glasses named Shwetank. Shwetank had rock-solid technique and an enviable dedication to fitness; so much so that Nassim, a jocular Moroccan-born Frenchman, gave him the nickname "Sensei."

Seemingly on the hour, Sensei would should across the climbing area "Eliii!" in his nasaly, yet perfectly round voice. "What are you climbing?" he would insist, more so than ask.

"I am resting," is what I would usually respond.

"Why."

"Because I am tired?"

"Why!" Always a staccato beat, unwavering, spoken with the Indian trademark "v" sound—"vwigh!"

Like the [Toyota Method](https://constantrenewal.com/toyota-method/), his questions cut to the heart of the matter at hand, revealing the banality of any excuse I would try to muster.

"Are you feeling lazy?" he asked on the second day. I was, in fact.
