Even non-fiction usually offers associative distance: it happened in the past, it happened far away, it happened to people who are not like me. *Random Family* does not afford its readers such luxury. 

It is the “truest” work of non-fiction I have ever read. Of course, every quote is sourced first-hand, the book was meticulously fact checked, and Le Blanc even received a masters from Yale Law to better understand the predicaments her subjects faced.

But Le Blanc in 2003 seemed to intuitively understand something about truth that the rest of us in 2019 are only beginning to grasp. Truth no longer stands on its own. A true story that lands on the reader like fiction does little good (the inverse, fiction that acts as fact, is even more dangerous, but a topic for another time).
