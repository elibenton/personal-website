## Description

Eli and Sully think about hookup culture at The Claremont Colleges. They talk to experts. They talk to students. They talk to themselves (but not like that).

## Reflection

This being the first episode I ever produced, the learning curve was incredibly steep and it took me almost two months just to produce the episode. The first thing I noticed was just how challenging it is to work with raw conversation. People do not speak in linear fashion. Furthermore, a lot of speech is referential and meaning resides outside of the words themselves (gestures, cadence, and tone). As such, pulling quotations for use in a podcast is harder than one would expect. Most self-contained thoughts only existed in two types, either a five second soundbite or a minutes long speech. Neither are particularly useful for podcasting. A laundry of soundbites does not build to anything meaningful for a listener, but more than 30 seconds of a single speaker can be difficult to follow.

My goal in this episode was to practice those editing techniques. I attempted to combine my two primary interviews with Audrey and Professor Wade, in a method similar to The New York Times “The Daily.” As Audrey had brought Professor Wade to campus, that would provide the meta story over my interview with Wade herself. There was the narrative of why Wade studied what she did, and then the conversation with Audrey would show why this topic was relevant to Pomona specifically.
