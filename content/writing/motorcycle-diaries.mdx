  Recently, I have been traversing rural Surguja on motorcycle with Vipul Chaikra, a local tribal rights activist. We've been riding deep into the forest to speak with people who are not receiving their constitutionally-guaranteed entitlements because of Aadhaar. Their stories have both complicated my thinking and challenged my convictions.

## A Dangerous Fantasy

The Indian countryside, at least in the Surguja district of Chhattisgarh, is breathtaking. It is a dense green, not unlike Alabama, only slightly more tropical. Replace pine trees with rice patties, and everything else is the same; it's hot and mosquitos reign supreme. The road alternates between gravel, punctuated with potholes like Swiss cheese, and brand new highways, as straight and smooth as an airport tarmac.

The terracing of the rice patties really does make for postcard-like views. I look out over the different levels and spot women carrying baskets on top their heads. They are easy to spot. Their red, blue, and pink Sari's contrast the background so vividly, and their golden jewelry—bengals, necklaces, earrings—shimmer in the late afternoon sun.

It was hard to not romanticize the entire situation. Speeding down bucolic country roads at 80 kilometers per hour, hanging off the back of Vipul's motorcycle, I began to think that living out one's days in the Indian countryside might not be so bad. Life seemed easier—or if not easy, at least simpler.

But this is dangerous fantasy. I had found my way to the Surguja countryside exclusively due to skill and patience of Vipul Paikra, a local land rights activist. I had been put in touch Vipul by Professor Reetika Kera, an Indian political scientist known for her work on the digitization of entitlement programs, namely the Public Distribution Center (PDS), which provides grain rations to poor Indian families.

Today we going to visit members of some of India's "Scheduled Tribes," or indigenous groups recognized by the government to be historically disadvantaged. In fact, two of the three groups in the area, the Paharikorwa and Pando, are designated "Particularly Vulnerable" because so much of their land has been taken and their populations have dwindled so low. The people's lives were under siege; they were not a fantasy.

But I could not help myself, continuing to repeat "It's so beautiful" under my breath as we rounded each turn in the road, the sun setting between the softly swaying tall grasses.

"Would you like to live here?" Vipul asked. I had spoken too loudly.

I don't think it was a rhetorical question, but there was a note of skepticism in his voice. Vipul is native himself, part of the Kanwar Tribe. He grew up on forest land until he was 10 years old.

"I'm not sure. I mean—probably not," I fumbled over my response, "Life seems really hard." I instantly became self-aware, worried I would offend no matter how I proceeded. If I said how wonderful everything seemed, surely he'd think it would fetishize "natural living" of India's indigenous groups. But the opposite couldn't be any better, offering patronizing condolences that reduced an entire livelihood to nothing more than "poverty porn."

## The Sarpanch's Task

We spent the day tracking down four individuals whose names we received from the Sarpanch, Dinesh Turkey, the day before. A Sarpanch is the elected official of the Panchayat, the local systems of self-governance scattered around rural India and the broader subcontinent.

We had received these four names because they had persistent issues obtaining their entitlements: Two individuals were blind, one had mortgaged their ration (likely to buy booze, Vipul guessed), and one simply had not been heard from in months. Turkey suggested we could talk to them and register their complaints to a higher authority. This is Vipul's job—registering people's issues and then pressuring some one else to do something about it. He is part of the civil society group Chaupal, which operates across Northern Chhattisgarh.

With our four names jotted in my notebook, we sped off in no particular direction at all.

"What's the plan?" I asked Vipul.

"We'll just ask around until we find them," he responded.

So ensued our day of criss-crossing Remhla in search of these fated four names. We found numerous empty houses, retraced our steps at least twice, and began asking for directions from anyone who crossed our path. By four PM, after having spend most of the day on the road, we had found no one. It was just us and the empty road, safe for the occasional cattle herder or bicycle salesman.

I once again began entertaining my motorcycle fantasies. Vipul and Eli, replacing Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper in the Indian version of _Easy Rider_, tracking down elderly, blind women who had been wronged by the state, and then busting up the small-town government crooks who took advantage of them. This is, of course, ridiculous, and definitely too "white savior-complex-y," and surely problematic in most ways, but I still decided to ask Vipul—who knows three times as many American films as I do—if he saw the relation.

"_Easy Rider_? I haven't heard of it."

## Finding Maniyaro

As afternoon was stretching into dusk, we were beginning to lose hope of finding anyone. Vipul decided to try one last house, before making our way back home to Ambikapur.

We biked maybe a kilometer up a small dirt road to find a group of women and kids congregated on the side. We asked if Maniyaro lived here. Yes, they exclaimed! In fact, she's coming this way now!

Vipul explained what we were doing her, and the group began buzzing with anticipation. At that moment, Maniyaro rounded the corner, and the group surrounded her, everyone talking at once. Maniyaro had to talk over everyone to make her case. Vipul's eyes widened with every sentence.

"She doesn't have Aadhaar. She was rejected!" he began translating. This was definitely out of place. There are plenty of people whose fingerprints or irises don't scan, and UIDAI (the Aadhaar-issuing government agency) has well-established exemption protocols.

"She says that without it, she can't get her pension, or open a bank account, or even get a mobile phone!" This was even more out of place. Since 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that private firms, like banks or telecoms, cannot required Aadhaar to use their services.

Vipul asked for my phone and began filming Maniyaro, peppering her with questions. What is your name? How old are you? Where are you from? When did you last try to register?

"Typically it's best not to start with questions," he'd admit to me afterwards, "but I had no choice. Her case did not make any sense to me."

She walked to her house and returned with her Election ID Card, but that would do us no good. Aadhaar and Election ID's are still separate systems in Chhattisgarh; one has no bearing on the other. So we went to her house ourselves. She pulled out a tin ammunition box filled with faded and tattered papers. She began rifling through them, discarding sheet after sheet onto the dirt floor. We could tell she was becoming more agitated, until nearly the whole box had been emptied and she was quivering with anger.

"She's illiterate," Vipul voiced his sudden realization aloud. We rushed to her side and began looking through the discarded papers. Sure enough, there was an Aadhaar application form. They had scanned her ten fingerprints, her face, and her one functional eye, but written on the back in blue pen was "Rejected." I asked Vipul why, but he said she didn't know.

## Forced To Catch Up With Time

At one point late in the day, frustrated by yet another empt house, Vipul, typically a man of few words launched into his own assessment of the situation.

"It's like they are forced to catch up with time," Vipul says. I asked what he meant by that.

Forcing people to constantly maintain all these documents, provide their biometrics, and jump use all this new technology. He called it a "forced imposition," but then qualified, "for better or worse."

He must still think I'm in the pro-tech camp, because I have never heard of a "better forced imposition."

![As we leave, Maniyaro's son climbs the single electrical wire to divert more current into their home](../images/DSCF5669.jpg)

"It's amazing that people are catching up so fast," he continues. I certainly agree.

"But they have no other method," he finishes his thought. This point has broad applicability. It does not really matter what we think of all these technology-driven changes. They are happening whether we wish them to or not.
