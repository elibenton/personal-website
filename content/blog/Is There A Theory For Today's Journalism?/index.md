The capstone project of all politics majors at Pomona College is creating a book
list of 12 works. The collection is supposed to encapsulate one’s understanding
about a topic in politics that has shaped the way that student has come to view
the world. I chose to explore journalism, and more specifically, modern
journalism’s collision course with the digitally-networked reality of the
current era.

For the project, we are to write three papers synthesizing the arguments of the
works and then defend them in oral argument before the Pomona Politics faculty.
Each paper represents a sub-category of the full argument. Mine are: historical
examples, dsytopic technologies, and the American problem.

In this post, I’ll summarize my understanding to the first sub-section,
historical examples, which include four works of journalistic theory spanning
the past century. I’ll try to lay a foundation for the other two sub-categories
as well. By establishing a baseline, I can both contextualize current works in
history and track how my beliefs at the end of the project have changed from
where they are now.

> **Lippmann, Walter. Public Opinion. New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Company,
> 1922.**

Walter Lippmann’s book is perhaps most famous for formalizing the definition of
the word *stereotype. *But just by flipping through the chapters, its easy to
tell the work covers far more: censorship, the deep state, political theory —
just to name a few.

Lippmann’s book seems more pessimistic than I would have initially thought. He
concludes the book with the frighteningly prescient criticism that “news and
truth are not the same thing.” That doesn’t necessarily put Lippmann in the
Trumpian camp of “all news is fake news.” It does, however, complicate the
refrain that we have only recently entered the post-truth era. Lippmann could
never have imagined Facebook, Fox News, or the Internet Research Agency. At the
time *Public Opinion *was published, the television did not even exist.

Which in fact may prove that all the technological advances of recent are not
even the root cause of the crisis in journalism today. The relationship between
a free press and American democracy has been fraught for nearly a century, and
more likely, since the very beginning.

> **Chomsky, Noam and Edward Herman. Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy
> of Mass Media. New York: Pantheon Books, 1988.**

Chomsky and Herman’s work was, in some ways, based off of Lippmann’s. In fact,
the title is a direct reference to another of Lippmann’s works, *Liberty and The
News*, in which he wondered “whether government by consent can survive in a time
when the manufacture of consent is an unregulated private enterprise.” Lippmann
was reflecting on propaganda in the aftermath of World War I. Herman and Chomsky
pick up that question, by developing their own propaganda model for the late
20th century, based on five “editorial filters”:

1.  Profit orientation of the dominant mass-media firms
2.  Advertising as the primary income source of the mass media
3.  Reliance on sourcing information from the same government, business, and experts
being reported on
1.  “Flak”, i.e. negative response as a means of disciplining the media
1.  Anti-communism as a national religion and control mechanism (since updated to
anti-terrorism)

By reading both *Public Opinion* and *Manufacturing Consent* in tandem, I hope
to continue the work of thinking through the politics of information transfer in
the current day.

> **McLuhan, Marshall. Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man. New York :
> McGraw-Hill 1964.**

Understanding Media is famous for producing the line “The Medium is the
Message.” Apparently, when the first edition was printed, the type-setters
misprinted the section as “The Medium is the Massage.” McLuhan loved it, feeling
it proved his point perfectly. What is the point?

His foundational claim is that there is no distinction between content and the
medium by which it is provided. In fact, he writes that “the content of any
medium is always another medium.” One such sequence is:

> Speech ⇨ Words ⇨ Print ⇨ Telegraph

By this, he means the telegraph *contains* printed material, which itself
contains words, which is the vehicle for speech. Words allow for speech to be
immortalized; the printing press expands degree to which words are spread; and
the telegraph eliminates any barrier of time or space. At each step, he points
out, there is a “change in scale, pace, or pattern.” Aside from that, however,
nothing is different; the content itself is of no import.

While beginning to read *Understanding* *Media*, the concept that keeps coming
to mind is one I learned in computer science: recursion, or the idea that a
thing can only be understood when defined in terms of itself. Remember, to
McLuhan, any medium’s content is just another medium (tellingly, the word
*media* is the plural of *medium*, analogous to data/datum). This produces a
kind of “onion peel” layering effect that goes all the way down. What’s at the
center (or to return to the computer science metaphor “the base case”)? Well
it’s in the title of the book: *Understanding Media, The Extensions of Man.*

> **Siebert, Fred, Theodore Peterson, and Wilbur Schramm. Four Theories of The
> Press. Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1956.**

The four “theories of the press” are really just two, each with their own
update/modification by more recent authors. The original two theories were
created by Fred S. Siebert, former director of The University Illinois
journalism school. He considered the historical and political origins of
journalistic ecosystems, focusing specifically on the distinctions between
liberal models and authoritarian models, showing how each system’s manifestation
of journalism reflects deeper political concepts: the individual, the state, and
conceptions of knowledge.

The book is normative in its aims, trying to figure out what journalism can and
*should* be. It rests on the thesis that “the press always takes the form and
coloration of the social and political structures within which it operates.” The
authors see journalism as a direct reflection of politics, the “system of social
control whereby the relations of individuals and institutions are adjusted.”

If I am to make the argument that journalism is an inherently political topic,
*Four Theories* is the evidence to cite. I am also intrigued by the possibility
of adding two more theories, to see if corollaries of the
libertarian/authoritarian dichotomy still make sense for the digital age.

<span class="figcaption_hack">Does this dichotomy have contemporary application?</span>

*****

If there is one “unequivocal truth” to be deduced from reading these four books,
it’s that 2019 is not journalism's first crisis. If we’ll allow ourselves a
second one — it’s probably that truth doesn’t exist. When dealing in unequivocal
truths, it’s usually best to stick to one. Which is why none of the books
attempted to do that. I actually took a morbid solace in each author’s struggle
with evidence against opinion, information against storytelling, and fact
against fiction. They laid bare the difficulties in holding up a standard of
objective truth and showed the processes by which the notion has come to exist.
That process is one of construction, not discovery. ◆
