  In the past three months, I have visited six Indian states. I've traveled by bus, train, and plane. I rarely book a room until the hours before I fall asleep. For better or worse, I feel like I've come to embody the quintessential "rambling man." The only surprising part is how easy it's been.

But more on my work with AI later. This post is dedicated to the moments in between: those in transit, or late at night, or when my only company was myself. These moments have increased as I have traveled further my from self-described "home base" in Bangalore. Time alone is now the majority of my time.

I call this transition easy, which is true, but only in one sense. Practically, I have become very good at moving around. I can navigate Indian transit quickly (and cheaply). It's been easy to find reasonable accommodations and I don't hesitate to move on when I am not pleased with my current situation. I continue to empty my suitcase at every stop, constantly redefining what really are "essential" travel items. So far, good underwear is the only I've identified. I don't know how I ever wore cotton underwear.

In the other sense--the emotional/cerebral/existential one--my track record is less consistent. And I choose the word _consistent_ intentionally. There have been wonderful moments. Like riding around the beautiful Badi Lake, outside of Udaipur. Or Garba dancing until the sun rose in Ahmedabad. Or debating artificial intelligence with young Indian journalists in their falling-apart, book-lined, art-covered apartments. I hope to write more about these experiences soon.

But there have also been afternoons of isolation that stretch into evenings, that sometimes even stretch into days. They can be punctuated with a phone call to friends or family or a forced conversation with the person sitting next to me in the cafe, but given enough time, the sense of dread can be hard to stave off. In these moments, I have turned to different coping mechanisms, some of which work better than others.

Netflix can be a welcome respite, but can quickly bring guilt of escapism if not careful. Writing is often difficult in the moment, but I find myself universally appreciative after the fact. Photography can be a great way to continue engaging with my environment, while occupying my hyperactive attention with the minutiae of exposure, composition, and depth of field. As I'm sure most craftspersons would attest to, working with ones hands is really more about placating the mind.

Sometimes the dread of being alone moves along quickly and often it stays within a manageable threshold. Only a few times has it washed in like a flood, thrashing my mental sandbag wall and leaving me no option but to ride out the wave. These moments are miserable and serve little practical purpose. I just remind myself that such lows are, in fact, necessary to differentiate the highs.

I'll leave you with a few excerpts of writing from these moments of isolation, with a promise of more complete reflections to come.

> I smell the train slowing before I feel it. Scents of liquefied rubber particulate infuse the air and waft through the open air train. Only after ingesting the rancid and intoxicating fumes for a number of seconds can I physically perceive that the train is slowing. The next sign has to be the sound of the axel rattling over the track. The cadence slows with a calming, predictable deceleration and eventually the sound fades disappears entirely, ending with a quiet, almost imperceptible hiss. We've come to a stop, but only after this remarkable testament to the power of inertia.

> I've been enjoying a long overdue revisit to the Punch Brother's "Phosphorescent Blues." The train has moved from golden hot afternoon to pale-blue, smoky dusk. A huge red moon rises on the other side of the train, only 30 minutes before the sun sets, creating a dramatic scene.

> Earlier in the afternoon, I would lean my arm out of the window and the whipping wind on my sunburned skin almost felt cool to the touch—like menthol. I thought some one was throwing water out of the window in the cabin ahead of me. That's what the Rajasthan sun can do to you in just a matter of days walking through its sun-bleached forts and palaces.

> In Jaipur, the dust suspends in the air permanently, never settling or accumulating, but simple coating all that moves through it. I feel it on the foot-bed of my sandals when I get up and down on the train. I feel it on the back of my phone every time I check a message. It sticks to the sweat on the back of my neck.

### **from my notes** _10-11-2019_

> Once again, I find myself before an incredible Lake Pichola sunset. Unfortunately, once again there is no one to share it with. This trip so far has definitely allowed me to to become a more introspective person. Not introspective, but just more comfortable confined to myself. That is definitely a skill being developed by necessity.

> But often, even when I do connect with people, I only enjoy it so much. It can be perfectly pleasant, but just not significant in any way. Endless insignificant interactions can become tiring.

### **from my notes** _10-9-2019_

> Why the difficulty in engaging things alone? Is there a problem in that I cannot enjoy this sunset as much just for myself? So much pleasure comes from sharing an experience such as this with some one who you know--who knows you.

> In the time of writing this, the sun has set completely. An entire sunset in three short sentences. How fast the present blends with the future and past.
