I am a senior at Pomona College outside of Los Angeles, where I study politics and computer science. For my senior thesis, I am trying to find new political theories of journalism for the Information Age.

I’ve worked at KQED in San Francisco and WBHM in Birmingham, creating public radio. At KQED, I helped produce [Forum](https://www.kqed.org/forum), the station’s flagship talk radio news program. I’ve also worked for The Brookings Institution in Washington D.C., where I helped the Governance Studies department research congressional procedure and contributed to [The Vital Statistics on Congress](https://www.brookings.edu/multi-chapter-report/vital-statistics-on-congress). 

On campus, I am the founding director of the podcast [DisCo](https://discussioncollective.org). We look into politics at the Claremont Colleges by having the conversations that are typically avoided. Our mission is to feature a wide array of community voices, create understanding around campus events, and learn how national political currents affect the lives of undergraduates.

I spend my spare time outside, usually running, backpacking, or rock climbing. As a leader of [On The Loose](http://otl.pomona.edu), the college outdoors club, I’ve come to feel at home in Southern California’s vast and varied landscapes. In work and play, I find that the process is more important than the destination. I would rather learn something new than prove I'm right. So don't hesitate -- [say hello]({{< ref "#formspree" >}}).
