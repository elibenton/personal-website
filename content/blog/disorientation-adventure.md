_Where was this mobilization for the issues that really mattered: mental health resources, affordability issues, Title IX policy changes? Choosing to rally around OA but not other topics, they believed,was negligent, hypocritical, and privileged. It's been approximately two months since the initial decision catalyzed the outrage, then the counter-outrage. Three forums have been held to discuss the future of the Orientation Adventure program,but attendance has been sparse and the discussions vague. We talked to students, professors, and alumni, but the question remains: where do we go from here?_

## Reflection

At the end of first semester, the Pomona administration did something truly startling. The got rid of OA without telling anyone. The email announcing the change set off a rare display of student unity (quickly followed by the more typical online vitriol). I took the opportunity to attempt a breaking news podcast. I drafted a storyboard that included drum-heavy, cable-news-inspired interludes. “This just in, Pomona administration cancels OA,” “live from the protest,” “I just left a meeting with Dean of Student, Avis Hinkson, and…” Once again, however, I proved unable to keep pace with the events as they unfolded. While waiting for an interview with a student who was a vocal critic of the OA proponents on Facebook, the administration reversed their decision.

It only took them one week, and just like that, my story had been rendered moot. An episode about OA being cancelled and then everything going back to exactly how it had been didn’t seem very interesting. However, the following semester, I decided to do exactly that. Though OA had indeed been reinstated, things were not the same, and I tried to make that the peg of the episode.

One aspect of the OA discussion that drew me was that, for the first time, I felt like I was in my own wheelhouse. During my first and second years at Pomona, I had been president of On The Loose, the Claremont outdoors club. Much of the work I had done in that capacity was resisting the encroachment of the administration—namely the OEC—on the club. Though I had been complaining about this issue for years, moving OA was what was needed to obtain the attention of the rest of the student body. I saw this as my chance to garner new attention to my older arguments about who really had control over student’s time at Pomona.

Additionally, the determinism of Pomona discussion became most apparent during this issue. For the first time with OA, I felt like I could state my opinion without hedging it against my “lack of experience.” To speak of Title IX required acknowledging I could only know so much not being a survivor myself. To speak of mental health resources on campus I could only make certain claims as I was not currently utilizing therapy. I believe this will remain a persistent issue with Pomona political discussion that should be discussed more openly. If every contribution must be proceeded with a laundry list of increasingly-specific identities and experiences, conversation will continue to become splintered into non-overlapping groups of students. I fear we are quickly approaching a precipice where almost no cross-cutting conversation remains. Speaking with some one who you have not previously vetted to agree with you simply won’t be worth the risk.
