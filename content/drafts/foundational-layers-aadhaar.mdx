description: >-
  In 2009, the Indian government embarked on a wildly ambitious project: provide all 1.2 billion Indians with their own digital ID. Crazier still, they did so when only 10% of the population was connected to the internet. The solution at the time seemed so elegant, almost providential. Link the ID to something everybody already has—themselves. One decade, and one billion enrollees later, the state of Aadhaar is far more complicated.

## What is it?

Aadhaar is India's

## How it came to be?

    directQuote=" You may be composed of flesh and blood, but Aadhaar is an electronic system that only receives bits over the wire. A fingerprint scanner turns fingers into bits—bits that can be copied and replayed any number of times, for the rest of your life, and there’s absolutely nothing you can do to stop it. "

    Perhaps the best piece I have read to date on the vexing complexity of
    Aadhaar's past decade is "A Rant on Aadhaar" by Kiran Jonnalagadda.
  </Citation>{" "}
  Kiran's "rant" comes off more like tea time pleasantries, starting his
  "tirades" with "I do not doubt their sincerity or integrity" and "This section
  is a long tangent, but it’s a relevant insight, so bear with me." In addition
  to his earnest and self-aware demeanor, he is too much of renaissance man to
  lose himself in a diatribe. Such rage requires too much certainty.

  directQuote="Husband as ‘master’ and wife as simply a ‘woman’. Even the Hindi words pati and patni have the same original meanings. The term Rashtrapati for the President literally means ‘husband of the nation’. When Pratibha Patil became India’s first female President, many argued her title should remain Rashtrapati."

  I met with Kiran last week, and he really did seem as comfortable discussing
  the patriarchal roots of Hindi etymology

  &nbsp;as he would be with techical jargon like Node.js and V8 WebAssembly Engines.
</Citation> That is not to say the conversation itself was entirely comfortable. He introduced himself with eyes averted and looked to the ground more often than looking to me.
</p>

When I finished speaking, he often didn’t respond. The conversation wouldn't just lull; it would hault. I did not count the length of these silences, but they were long enough for me to wonder if I should be counting. After speaking for over half an hour, we began locking eyes more frequently. When he finally animated fully, I knew then it was because we were finally on the same page, not because an American business school had conditioned him to maintain eye contact, nod affirmatively, and shake three times. I don’t think we shook hands, actually.

<p>
At the outset, Kiran spoke plaintively of Aadhaar, like one might of a family member fallen on hard times. Perhaps that was because he made Aadhaar before Aadhaar existed. It was here in Karnataka, in 2006, that Kiran helped start Project Nemmadi,&nbsp;

  directQuote="Through a public-private partnership Comat would open hundreds of centers in the state's rural areas and digitize other records -- everything from birth certificates to pension documents -- at no charge."

  Technologies.
</Citation> "We're democratizing information services" and "We're making government better," insisted Comat's CEO Sriram Raghavan insisted at the time.

By Kiran's estimation, the project failed. I asked him what had happened. “The administrators, they got beaten up,” he said, “There were angry mobs. They got attacked.”

“Why?” I asked. The answer to that was very simple and also impossible to explain. Simply put, the system didn’t work. But who was to blame, Kiran explained, it was impossible to know. “Like a football game,” he said.

I grew up playing football (soccer) and when we lost, it was easiest to blame the goalkeeper. After all, he was the last person the ball passed before the goal. But Kiran is right, a game of soccer has infinite complexity. An honest assessment acknowledges that its impossible to single out the failure of any individual when something goes wrong.

We actually talked a lot about failure, primarily about failure, really.

“We can’t afford to keep learning about our failures,” he said.

“Can’t?” I had to clarify.

“Of course not. Each failure, some one is getting hurt.”

I paused a beat. The conversation had un-synced. He was saying something so simple, so utterly true, yet I—along with the Silicon Valley techno-optimists, the Wall Street golden-parachute hoisted, and the Human Centered Design self-actualization gurus all seem to have forgotten.

Fail fast?

On whose back?

He is, perhaps, my platonic ideal of a modern technologist. His technical chops are unassailable, and yet his personal aptitude with technology never translates into hubris about technology's promise. He knows his stuff, _and_ he knows to doubt what he knows.

There are so many twists and tangents in the Aadhaar saga, many of which are recounted in

## What's happening now?

Aadhaar raises fascinating questions about what should be public and what should be private in our bold, new digital age.

  By linking one's digital self to a supposedly immutable physical

  paradigms of internet privacy.

  The pace of digital innovation in India is staggering, and the relative lack
  of regulation considered next to the United States or China, has led many
  transnational companies to jump into the fray, testing new features and
  rolling out new products in India before anywhere else.
