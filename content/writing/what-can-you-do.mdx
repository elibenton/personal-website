  I have been sitting on this most recent post for the past week, unsure of how to discuss my experience at Kauwa Kunda. The community is largely comprised of people with leprosy who have been ostracized from their homes. They were kind, patient, and open with me—and all I can feel is shame.

Kauwa Kunda is a small community on the outskirts of Raigarh in Northern Chhattisgarh. It is populated largely by people with leprosy. The community is on government land. There is an old age home for those lucky enough to gain admittance. But most residents live across the river, connected by only a single bridge, isolated in dismal conditions. Outcast from their homes, but unable to purchase the land they currently live on, they are forced into limbo--unrecognized by society and government alike. We spent a very pleasant day talking with them, until one woman's question sent my spiralling, questioning all I had just done.

## Choeta Ram

Choeta Ram said he was over 70 years old, but he—like everyone we talked to—did not know his actual birthday. Notably, he was the only Raigarh native. He had been at the home for six years, ever since his wife died. When that happened, his son sold all his property and left for a new life in Bhopal, in the neighboring state of Madhya Pradesh. Choeta Ram said his son visits him on occasion but never sends money.

## Lakshmi Bai

Lakshmi Bai estimated she was over 80. She did not have leprosy, but had been cast out by her two sons and four daughters all the same. Her husband had been a _Patwari,_ a government accountant with the Revenue Department where they lived. As such, she should have been entitled to a "government family" pension when he died—which is far greater the standard retirement pension, itself only 5 USD a month. But she said that one of her sons burned all of her late husband's documents, and as a result, she gets nothing.

## Ukia Bai

Ukia Bai told us she was over 70 years old. She had come from the neighboring state of Orissa. This had caused interesting complications; for instance, she could not collect rations or pensions here in Chhattisgarh, but she could vote. She had been at the home for four years. When her husband died, she was the only person heading the house. No one would marry her daughter with her around, so Ukia left to give her daughter a chance at starting a family for herself.

## Koera Pradhan

Koera Pradhan estimated he was 85 years old, but he has only been at the home for the past five. He told us he learned of the home while begging in a train station in Uttar Pradesh, India's least developed state. He reckoned that he hadn't lived at home for over 50 years. He left because he was told having a father with leprosy would deprive his sons of their future. While asking him our standard set of questions: do you have Aadhaar, pension, ration, bank account, he interrupted—“When I've never had any money, why would I have a bank account?”

## Prabha Devi

Prabhadevi has suffered a severe handicap for decades, according to the women who spoke to us on her behalf. It had severely limited her mobility. Despite this, she would still spend her days on the street, begging. Only recently, they said, had she slipped and broken her hip. She is now effectively paraplegic; she can no longer walk. She does not live at the old age home. She lives alone, and relies on the community to live. They help feed, clothe, and bathe her. Her only source of income now is a government pension of 350 rupees per month, or 5 USD US dollars.

## What I did to help

I still haven't figured out how to process my day sitting across from Ukia, Lakshmi, Choeta, Koera, and Prabha. There was no ready made packaging for my understanding. There was no authority figure to lead a "debrief session." There wasn't going to be a module for "unpacking caste and class in contemporary India." There wasn't even a friend for me to turn to and say, "What the fuck, man!?" For Vipul, helping people in abject poverty who have been abandoned by their entire families is just called "Tuesday." His preternatural repose permeated everything he did. In other words, he was as a solid as a rock.

So for the most part, I just tried to act like him, composed, almost nonchalant. We listened, noted relevant details, deduced the situation, and went on our way. In a way, the whole thing almost felt... normal. Especially at the old age home, where everyone went to great length to make us feel welcome and comfortable. Nobody demanded to know what the hell I was doing there. We were offered lunch. Some one asked if I was married. The _idea_ I had for us being there—ensuring the condemned and forgotten were protected by the government—and the _substance_ of what we were actually doing—chatting pleasantly over lunch—left me very confused. The normalcy of the situation felt incredibly abnormal, with one exception.

We had been brought to a women's house who we'd been told was having trouble with her ration. We never got her name because the second we arrived, more and more women began congregating. Quickly a group of almost ten had gathered, all vying for Vipul's attention. He was diligently asking them questions, translating their responses to me—which was beginning to feel like a more useless task after every sentence. He began translating in paraphrase, then not at all. It was just taking too long.

After a few hectic minutes the initial woman quieted everyone, looked squarely at Vipul, and made one emphatic statement. While he just talked in Hindi for almost ten minutes, this time he translated immediately, directly, and—I assumed—in full.

"She's said, 'What can you do to help us?'"

I blanked--trying to parse her words for what they were truly demanding of me.

> What can you do to _help_ us?

> What can _you_ _do_?

> For _us_?

I looked desperately at Vipul, then back at the woman, then back at Vipul.

"Ask her what she needs, I guess..." I meekly suggested to Vipul. I was punting. What could I do for her? What could I do about any of this?

I wasn't helping. In fact, I wasn't _really_ doing much of anything. I wanted to apologize profusely, put my backpack over my head, or just run. The way the woman looked at me cut deep into my self-perception. Like a surgeon suturing a wound, but in reverse; her question sliced through the delicate seems of my ego and all was revealed—the hypocrisy deep within on display for all to inspect.

She continued, and Vipul translated in quick succession: people come here all the time, ask us questions, write in notebooks, and leave. Nothing ever changes. What was I to say to that?

Until that moment, I had yet to feel "bad," as one would perhaps think typical of hearing such sad stories all day. I think this was because I had convinced myself I was there to do a job. A good job narrows my mind, breeds purpose from confusion, allows me to abstract myself _away_ from the actual world in front.

When I was in college, I even had a routine with certain friends. If any of them were coming to me for support—romantic, academic, or generalized anxiety (all three far too common)—I would actually ask upfront, "do you want me to listen for solutions or do you just want me to listen to listen?" Essentially, are you coming to me to make a game plan or just to know some one is listening? Not that the two are mutually exclusive, but sometimes I did find myself suppressing that urge to empathize in order to help coax my peers out of their own misery. In a way, I thought my _lack of feeling_ could be an advantage. If I felt their sadness like they did, I wouldn't be able to do anything. It was my job to stay resolute and try to bring them up with me.

This whole paradigm has worked relatively well for the past three years, but it toppled like cardboard cutout in the face of this woman's question. She didn't want option one. My empathy was of no use to her. She wanted to know what I would _do._

And option two—the _doing_—I could no longer provide. I can help people navigate the smothering demands of hyper-competitive college life. I can help people recover from imposter syndrome so acute it had driven them into depression. I can help people whose first forays into love have ended in equal pain. I know these things, I've lived them, and as such, they are part of me today.

I know nothing of hunger, or illness, or material want of any kind. I do not know how to win government redress or fight for that which I am supposed to be entitled. My life has been defined by entitlement: I have been entitled to everything, and everything has always come--it even included a free trip around the world.

What could I do to help her?

If I am being honest with myself—the brutal, accidental kind of honesty; the kinds that lives in these unguarded moments; the kind that has no meaning-making narrative; the small kind of truth—then I can only answer this woman's question one way.

Nothing. I can do nothing to help her. I still have not figured out how to incorporate this new recognition about myself. I'm not sure when, or if, I will.
