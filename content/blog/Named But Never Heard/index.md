## Description

In the second part of our series about sexual assault on campus, Title IX, and “the lists,” I talk with a person who understands these lists in a ways most of us cannot—he’s actually on one of them. Our original conversations were held in private, have been transcribed, and are reproduced here by a voice actor—all identifying information has been removed. We talk about the experience of being on one of the lists, how he thinks Title IX could be changed, and what he thinks accountability looks like. While this interview is in no way exhaustive, his perspective and experience is an important part of understanding how issues of sexual violence are being handled at the Claremont Colleges. Please send all thoughts,questions, and concerns to eli.cohen@pomona.edu.

##Reflection

This single episode probably changed my thinking on the topic of sexual assault more than any other occurrence in my life. To have a student on one the lists reach out to me personally caught me off guard. We spoke twice for over an hour each time. I could not help but feel like a real investigative reporter, finding stories and perspective that others did not—and would not—know had it not been for my reporting. With the source, I discussed providing them with anonymity (which quickly felt warranted). We also debated what I could include from our interview (in which I provided slightly more of a fight, though ultimately acquiesced to just about every request as well).

There was a tangible emotional force to being in the room discussing the topic with him. I found it hard not to empathize with some one recounting how their life had descended into constant terror. I almost felt the need to comfort and assure them during the interview, which contradicted with both my preconceived ideas that a reporter is supposed to remain disinterested and that members of the Pomona community are supposed to forsake perpetrators of sexual violence.

All of this to say, I was ultimately let down by the episode’s reception, which is to say, there was none. I felt like the conversation was an important and nuanced contribution to the campus conversation on how to deal with sexual violence,and I had some naive hope that by virtue of this fact, it would gain listeners, influence thought, and maybe even provoke conversation. It accomplished none of that, and I began to understand just how long an 18 minute podcast appears to something who has not made their main priority understanding the topic.
