## The Listener's Circle

I was confident I could have spent the rest of the day with Santhosh, walked through his front door in the evening, and spent the next week living in his home. He said as much, "We have an extra room. You are welcome to stay with me and my family anytime." His was a type of hospitality I have never received beforeâ€”extended to a total stranger, for little reason other than sharing rice.

## The Bier Library

On the weekend, I was two for two in terms of showing up solo and leaving with either my drinks or meal payed for. I had already amassed a sizable amount of new contacts, I was ready to give myself the break and spend Saturday night with takeout and American TV. But it was my first Saturday in India! I couldn't help but see staying in as a defeat.

As I was about to turn onto my street, I heard pulsing music coming from a nearby building. _The Bier Library_, however, is more like a self-sustaining resort.

## "Why are you here, then?"

On Sunday, rather exhausted from my 48 hours of solo venturing, I was glad to meet up with another Claremont student for lunch. Her name was Shringi Vikram, and she is going into her senior year at Scripps where she studies English and Theater.

I told her I could talk about Trump all day; that despite my directive to untether from the USA, I had been obsessively checking the coverage of the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. Shringi questioned me pointedly, "Why are you here, then?" I couldn't answer her, but I was glad she asked.
